# Welcome!
I've spent my life building a career that didn't include finishing my degree, or keeping up with my certifications.  
Though I have a lot of experience, I lack the paper to back it up.  
After struggling to find a job in **Information Technology**, I decided to go back to school and upgrade my certification track.  
Currently, I am focusing on three different area's. 
  1. Coding - Python, Json, and Markdown to start
  2. Cloud Engineering - GCP Cloud Associate Certification to start
  3. Web development 

When it comes to coding, my midterm is my best example: [Kent's Calculator](calculator.py)
Feel free to test it out and run it.  You may view the text [HERE](https://github.com/kportell/INFOTEC/commit/00e8ba14d9c80725c9c910d3ee0b38d880153710)  I've used Python a little previously, and used chatgpt to create small programs but knew I needed a legitimate programming back bone.  Since Python is used by one of my favorite programs, **DataDog**, I felt it appropriate to focus on it early on in my education.  I work a lot with ITSM software, so Json was essential to learn, which I did in this class incidentally.  Creating and editing entries via Json is common, but I have failed to master it until recently.  I write training and technical documentation, frequently in Confluence or other like products.  Markdown makes this so much easier and faster.  Already this project has shown me how useful Markdown language is to learn.  

Cloud Engineering will take a bit more time.  But I'm starting with becoming a ***Google Cloud Professional***.  
My main training site is [Udemy](www.udemy.com) I'll also be using the same site for my AWS Training.  
I used it previously when I was certified in AWS as well.  I've used [ACloudGuru](www.acloudguru.com) in the past, but they've
stopped taking cards from **Cash App** and **Apple Pay** which makes it difficult for me to find a way to pay for their service.
Due to these "payment issues" I've switched completely to the afformentioned [Udemy](www.udemy.com) as well as [EDX](www.edx.org).  

Oddly enough I've never really considered web development as a career path, but my current classes have forced me to reconsider.  I'm currently in the Missouri University Online course, **Digital Media Design**, which is focused on designing and creating media in many different formats.  Audio, video, and web design are all included and I'm slowly integrating them into my resume.  So far I've done a radio ad, created logo's, and created video projects.  My next goal in this class is to create a video resume hosted on a web page integrating what I've learned about github from this class. ðŸ˜ƒ 

A fun fact about me is that I love musicals and movies!

Favorite Musical is *The Heights*
