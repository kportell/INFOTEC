# Welcome!
I've spent my life building a career that didn't include finishing my degree, or keeping up with my certifications.  
Though I have a lot of experience, I lack the paper to back it up.  
After struggling to find a job in **Information Technology**, I decided to go back to school and upgrade my certification track.  
Currently, I am focusing on three different area's. 
  1. Coding - Python, Json, and Markdown to start
  2. Cloud Engineering - GCP Cloud Associate Certification to start
  3. Web development 

When it comes to coding, my midterm is my best example: [Kent's Calculator](calculator.py)
Feel free to test it out and run it.  

Cloud Engineering will take a bit more time.  But I'm starting with becoming a ***Google Cloud Professional***.  
My main training site is [Udemy](www.udemy.com) I'll also be using the same site for my AWS Training.  
I used it previously when I was certified in AWS as well.  I've used [ACloudGuru](www.acloudguru.com) in the past, but they've
stopped taking cards from **Cash App** and **Apple Pay** which makes it difficult for me to find a way to pay for their service.
Due to these "payment issues" I've switched completely to the afformentioned [Udemy](www.udemy.com) as well as [EDX](www.edx.org).  

Oddly enough I've never really considered web development as a career path, but my current classes have forced me to reconsider.  
I'm currently in the Missouri University Online course, **Digital Media Design**, which is focused on designing and creating media in many different formats.  
Audio, video, and web design are all included and I'm slowly integrating them into my resume.
